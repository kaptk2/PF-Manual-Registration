Installation:
-------------------------------------
Start Apache on a diffrent port for example 8080.
Copy pfManualRegistration.php and pfForm.html to
your PacketFence box into the root folder of the
apache server you made above.

You will have to edit pfManualRegistration.php to
change the ldapSever variable on line 16 and the
ldapDCRoot variable on line 17. Also on line 89
you will need to change the location of the
success page.


Notes:
-------------------------------------
As of 11/10/2010 LDAP is the only supported method
for auth. This only works if PacketFence already
has a record of the macaddress in its database.


TODO:
-------------------------------------
1) Use whatever PacketFence is using for
authentication. Not just LDAP.

2) More robost logic to decide if MAC should
be added or edited
